    2.1)    In order to use the shell you need know some commands:
        * ls - list all the files in your directory.
        * cd [path to new directory] - change directory.
        * git clone [url see (1)] - downloads a project.
        * git checkout - changes branches (IMPORTANT!! Don't do anything in master)
        * git status - shows you all the changes you've made.
        * git add [file | -A] - adds a change, or all changes.
        * git commit -m [message] - commits with a message (please don't put
                                                            garbage here, make it
                                                            make sense)
        * git push - pushes your changes to the branch.
        * git pull - pulls changes from the branch.

    2.2)    So you need to clone, then change to the "workingBranch" branch. Again
        make sure you don't do anything in the master branch, that's our main
        project, we will update it with stable builds.

    2.3)    Here is a youtube video I used to teach me: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKg7e37bQE
